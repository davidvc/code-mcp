A common problem when working with coding assitants like Cline is they need to manually run file searches
through the code to better understand the codebase.

This can be slow and tedious.

Also, sometimes the developer wants to ask questions about the overall code base. Some example quetsions
include:

- Please summarize the key features and functionality of this codebase
- Write a high level design document for this codebase, using object and sequence diagrams where useful
- Write a summary of the key components of this codebase, with a paragraph or two for each component
- What are some of the more problematic files, applying SOLID and clean coding principles

I would like to create an MCP plugin that Cline can use which allows Cline to easily ask questions about
the codebase. This plugin could also be used by Claude Desktop so the developer can ask questions directly.

## System Requirements

- Java 21 or higher (required for modern language features and optimal performance)
- Neo4j 5.18.0 or higher
- Maven 3.9 or higher

The project specifically requires Java 21 for:

- Enhanced pattern matching
- Record patterns
- String templates
- Virtual threads
- Structured concurrency
- Other modern Java features that improve code quality and maintainability

## Language Support Requirements

The code analysis system must support multiple programming languages through a plugin architecture. To achieve this:

1. Core Abstractions

   - Define language-agnostic abstractions that can represent code structure across different programming paradigms
   - Support both object-oriented and functional programming concepts
   - Avoid assumptions about language-specific features (e.g. visibility modifiers, interfaces)
   - Focus on universal concepts like:
     - Code organization (modules, namespaces)
     - Definitions (functions, types, variables)
     - Relationships (dependencies, calls, references)
     - Documentation (comments, annotations)

2. Plugin Architecture

   - Allow new language analyzers to be added without modifying core code
   - Each language plugin implements the core abstractions
   - Plugins handle language-specific parsing and analysis
   - Support for initial languages:
     - Java
     - Python
     - JavaScript/TypeScript

3. Analysis Capabilities

   - Static code analysis
   - Dependency tracking
   - Complexity metrics
   - Documentation extraction
   - Code quality assessment
   - All capabilities must work consistently across supported languages

4. Extensibility
   - Clear interfaces for adding new languages
   - Ability to add language-specific analysis features
   - Support for custom metrics and rules
   - Plugin versioning and compatibility management
