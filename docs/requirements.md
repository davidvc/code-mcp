A common problem when working with coding assistants like Cline is they need to manually run file searches
through the code to better understand the codebase.

This can be slow and tedious.

Also, sometimes the developer wants to ask questions about the overall code base. Some example questions
include:

- Please summarize the key features and functionality of this codebase
- Write a high level design document for this codebase, using object and sequence diagrams where useful
- Write a summary of the key components of this codebase, with a paragraph or two for each component
- How do the components in this codebase interact with each other?
- What are the key interfaces and abstractions used in this codebase?

I would like to create an MCP plugin that provides direct access to code structure and relationships through
graph queries. This will allow LLMs like Cline and Claude Desktop to efficiently understand and reason about
codebases by querying the graph database directly, rather than having to parse and analyze files manually.

## System Requirements

- Java 21 or higher (required for modern language features and optimal performance)
- Neo4j 5.18.0 or higher
- Maven 3.9 or higher

The project specifically requires Java 21 for:

- Enhanced pattern matching
- Record patterns
- String templates
- Virtual threads
- Structured concurrency
- Other modern Java features that improve code quality and maintainability

## Language Support Requirements

The code analysis system must support multiple programming languages through a plugin architecture. To achieve this:

1. Core Abstractions

   - Define language-agnostic abstractions that can represent code structure across different programming paradigms
   - Support both object-oriented and functional programming concepts
   - Avoid assumptions about language-specific features (e.g. visibility modifiers, interfaces)
   - Focus on universal concepts like:
     - Code organization (modules, namespaces)
     - Definitions (functions, types, variables)
     - Relationships (dependencies, calls, references)
     - Documentation (comments, annotations)

2. Plugin Architecture

   - Allow new language analyzers to be added without modifying core code
   - Each language plugin implements the core abstractions
   - Plugins handle language-specific parsing and understanding
   - Support for initial languages:
     - Java
     - Python
     - JavaScript/TypeScript

3. Graph Query Capabilities

   - Direct access to code structure
   - Type system queries
   - Relationship traversal
   - Documentation access
   - All capabilities must work consistently across supported languages

4. Extensibility
   - Clear interfaces for adding new languages
   - Ability to add language-specific features
   - Support for custom graph queries
   - Plugin versioning and compatibility management
